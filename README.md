# CoreXY-Rigidbot-Conversion

Alright, here it is. This is essentially V0.9 for this part, I've been using it quite successfully for the past 6 months and feel that its stable enough to do whatever you need it to do reliably. Should just need to print off 1x of more/less everything, except for the braces.

### Assembly Notes
You'll need M3, M4, and M5 Drills and Taps. 
I use Heat-Set inserts in the extruder carrier, should be sized appropriately for the inserts linked.

**I recommend printing from [High-Temp PLA](https://amzn.to/2ZtWItk) or other sturdy materials like ABS.

### CONFIGs
I currently run a Duet Wifi 2. Configs are Zipped.
<https://www.duet3d.com/DuetWifi> - Genuine
<http://www.zyltech.com/new-zyltech-duet-2-32-bit-board-with-7-touch-screen/> Clone with 7" Touchscreen - Zyltech.

Marlin Config is zipped as well. Likely needs a 32 bit board! 8bit boards can't run fast enough on most coreXY geometries. <https://amzn.to/39nbc2I> SKR1.3 with TMC Drivers should do nicely. 

*All of these files are for the Rigidbot Big with 0.9deg/step XY motors*
To convert this over to the regular rigidbot, it should work by shortening by 6" for X-axis Components and 2" for Y-Axis Components
