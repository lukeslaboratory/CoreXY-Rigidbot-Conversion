CONFIG

I currently run a Duet Wifi 2. Configs are Zipped. <https://www.duet3d.com/DuetWifi> - Genuine | <http://www.zyltech.com/new-zyltech-duet-2-32-bit-board-with-7-touch-screen/> Clone with 7" Touchscreen - Zyltech.

Marlin Config is zipped as well. Likely needs a 32 bit board! 8bit boards can't run fast enough on most coreXY geometries. <https://amzn.to/39nbc2I> SKR1.3 with TMC Drivers should do nicely.
